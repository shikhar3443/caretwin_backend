"""
quality_check.py — the gate that runs BEFORE any OCR engine.

Decides, using cheap image measurements only (no OCR, no LLM, no network),
whether an uploaded document should be:

  * sent through the OCR pipeline  (clean, machine-printed, readable), or
  * stored as-is in the patient's history, unprocessed  (blurry, faint,
    tiny, or handwritten / mixed handwriting).

Why a gate at all: the OCR benchmark showed handwriting and poor photos
come out as confident-looking garbage. In a health record, garbage that
looks like data is worse than no data, so those files are archived
untouched and clearly marked "not machine-read".

All thresholds are module constants so they can be re-tuned against more
real documents. They were calibrated on a small set (clean printed
reports, noisy/rotated printed reports, one real handwritten prescription,
and synthetically blurred / faint / dark / low-res copies), so treat them
as a sensible starting point, not a finished classifier.
